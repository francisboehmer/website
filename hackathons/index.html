			<p>I was given the amazing opportunity to participate in the first annual
				Story Camp hackathon, hosted by The University of Waterloo School of
				Interaction Design and Business. Over the course of 15 hours, more than
				100 other students and I formed ourselves into groups and began working
				to craft a compelling story.</p>

			<p>Throughout the course of the day, we had the chance to attend workshops
				and work with our teams. All 15 groups were challenged to create a
				story which followed the theme of community and connectivity. At the
				beginning of the day, groups were also given the opportunity to sign
				up for an area of focus including visual storytelling, social media,
				user experience, game design or branding and business. Each group was
				also assigned a different story arc to follow such as The Hero&#146;s
				Journey, and given a box containing various objects such as dice or
				a deck of cards, which we were encouraged to weave into our stories.
				Midway through the day, we were also surprised with a brief description
				of a character which we were also encouraged to incorporate into our
				narratives.</p>

			<p>At the end of the long day, each team got the opportunity to pitch
				their story to a panel of judges using a combination of three
				predetermined modes. Written, Auditory or Visual (Images / Videos).</p>
		
		</div>
			
		<div class="hackblock1">
			
			<p>My team and I chose branding as our area of focus. We worked together
				to develop a social movement to help people have a sense of belonging
				in their community. We wrote a story to sell and idea rather than a
				product. Ultimately, we we&#146;re able to complete  each of the specified
				requirements and deliver our three-minute pitch. For our mode, we opted
				to do audio rather than video, since this was the route the majority of
				other groups took. We narrated our story and included a practical component
				to tie it all together.</p>

			<p>I am honoured to say that my team came in first place. I am very proud
				of the work we did in such a short period of time. Story Camp challenged
				each and everyone one of us to work together to create something meaningful.</p>

			<p>Storytelling is an invaluable skill which can leveraged in countless ways
				to grab attention, induce emotions and motivate decisions. It&#146;s a skill
				that can branch into every industry around the globe. Story Camp was a
				unique opportunity for me to learn more about storytelling and get a
				chance to put it to the test.</p>
