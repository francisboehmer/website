		<h2>About</h2>
		
		<p>Over the 2019 summer, I went exploring in the downtown
			area of the city I live in. I found a really cool parking
			garage that was practically empty mid-day on a weekend! On
			top of that, the sky was completely clear without a cloud
			in sight. It made for some really neat photograph which I
			have displayed below.
