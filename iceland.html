			(<i>August 24th - September 1st</i>),
			I went on a week-long trip to the amazing

<!-- Waterfalls -->
	
		<h3>Waterfalls</h3>
		
		<p>While there, I got the oportunity to visit many
			different waterfalls. My favorite one was
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svartifoss">Svartifoss</a>.
			It took a bit of hiking to get to, but ended up being amazing.

<!-- Plane Wreck -->
				
		<h3>Plane Wreck</h3>
		
		<p>In Iceland there is a site of a plane wreck on the
			black sand beaches of S&oacute;lheimasandur. It is from
			a US Navy DC - 3 plane which crashed in 1973. Every
			member of the crew survived the crash. They disassembled
			the plane for salvageable parts and left the rest. To
			this day, the plane still remains on that very same beach.
			I got the opportunity to see the plane in person and take
			my favorite picture of the trip.
